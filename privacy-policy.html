    <h1>Privacy Policy for wach</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: July 12, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to wach! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application wach (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>wach is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not require user accounts, and therefore, we do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</p>

    <h2>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All content data you add, including titles, your watched status, watchlist items, and any associated details you manually input or fetch from external services, are stored locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party, except as described below for fetching item details.</p>
    <p>If you use the 'Export Data' feature, a local backup file is created on your device, and you have full control over where you store or share this file. If you use the 'Import Data' feature, you select a file from your device to load data into the App.</p>

    <h2>Information from External Services (OMDb API)</h2>
    <p>To provide item details (such as posters, ratings, plot summaries), wach may connect to the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. When you search for an item, the App may send the item title or IMDb ID to this service. This service has its own privacy policy, which you can review at http://omdbapi.com/legal.htm. We do not send any personal information about you to this service.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>wach may display advertisements through third-party advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob). These networks may collect anonymous data to show you relevant ads. You can often opt-out of personalized advertising through your device's settings (e.g., on iOS, navigate to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since your content data is stored locally, its security depends on the security of your device. We encourage you to use strong passcodes and other security features available on your device.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>wach is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:wachappios@gmail.com">wachappios@gmail.com</a>.</p>
